  %p Guide To Be was founded in 2014 by sisters Eve and Tessa. The idea was born when Eve was living in Sydney but planning a wedding in the UK and needed the inside scoop on her suppliers. There were no independent sources or dedicated wedding review sites to help make an informed choice.  So she teamed up with Tessa and together they created Guide To Be.
